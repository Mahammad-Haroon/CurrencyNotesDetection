üáÆüá≥ Indian Currency Notes Detection
A web application developed to detect Indian currency notes using YOLOv5 object detection model.

üéØ Objective
This project aims to improve upon traditional CNN and OpenCV-based recognition systems for Indian currency by implementing YOLOv5, resulting in higher detection accuracy. The application is especially useful for:

Tourists and Foreigners to recognize Indian currency and avoid fraud.

Visually Impaired individuals through integrated audio output.
